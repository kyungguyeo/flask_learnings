##My Bucketlist

An expansion that started with [this tutorial](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/creating-a-web-app-from-scratch-using-python-flask-and-mysql--cms-22972).

A bucketlist for all the things that you want to do before you can't. 

This was my first app that I ever built on flask, and still needs many iterations until I can call it done. Very much a work in progress.

Here are some screenshots:
